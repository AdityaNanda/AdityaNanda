I am computational neuroscientist currently working at Vanderbilt University with Mika Rubinov at [Rubinov Lab](https://www.rubinovlab.net/). I work on building neurobiologically plausible models of brain activity. I develop algorithms to generate surrogate functional neuronal activity across modalities and species ranging from human neuroimaging to electrophysiology and whole-brain calcium imaging in small model animals such as drosophilla and zebrafish . Although formally trained as an engineer, my long-held interest in the brain led me to neuroscience. Outside of research, I enjoy playing soccer, biking and reading.
